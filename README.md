# forms-react-nestjs
Inspired from Google Forms with React, Zustand, NestJS, MongoDB, Chakra UI, Firebase Storage </br>

If you get to signup & signin (only username, password) you can create and share forms and view form responses, </br> 
u can fill the shared form even if you dont want to signup

 React (functional) - My very first time </br>
 In nestjs server, .env should be created with valid variables, (check app.module.ts to know about those variables)
